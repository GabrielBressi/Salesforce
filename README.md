This is a repository about salesforce practices. Here I'll post things that I'm studying and improving.

# How to create a Form that you can access on your Web Browser, and insert data into Salesforce?
## Here I'm going to demonstrate how to insert Cases via form from your Web Browser.

1# Open your org, hit the gear icon, then hit the Setup:
<!-- 1# img here -->

2# In the Quick Find Box put "Web", then click Web-to-Case. Choose the template, and create your Email Signature, as you can see in the image below:
<!-- 2# img here -->

3# Below the "Web-to-Case" click in "Web-to-Case HTML Generator:
<!-- 3# img here -->

4# Make sure it looks like the image below, then click "Generate":
<!-- 4# img here -->

5# Select and copy the generated HTML:
<!-- 5# img here -->

6# Paste the generated HTML in your favorite text editor (Here I used the Visual Studio Code), Then save the file as "WebToCase.html":
<!-- 6# img here -->

7# Open the file that you just saved, and it might looks like this:
<!-- 7# img here -->

7.1# Fill in the fields as in the following example:

<!-- 7.1# img here -->

8# Now Check the Cases in you Salesforce Org. You'll see the Case that we just created:
<!-- 8# img here -->

9# BONUS. Here is the form with a better style:
<!-- form with css -->
